# SourceModding-SourceGameLauncher 

I really have to say i love the source engine.

So there is a cool Project called Enhanced Source Engine!

Check it out here:
[Enhanced Source](https://github.com/Enhanced-Source-Project/Enhanced-Source)

I somehow really want to support them!

So I did this launcher i will be adding many more things
For Example: Custom Dll Loading, Debugging, and a lot more!

# Building Steps
You download the code!

Set the building mode to `Release` or `Debug` how you prefer.

Copy the Exe to the swarm.exe or the directory where the game is.

And then replace swarm.exe with this or change the file contents of the `launcher.bat's`!
